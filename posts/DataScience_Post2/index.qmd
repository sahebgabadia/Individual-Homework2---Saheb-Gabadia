## **Dataset Overview**

The dataset contains various specifications of car models, including their make, model, body style, production years, and power specifications.

#### Let's take a quick look at the structure of the dataset:

```{r}
cars <- read.csv("cars-dataset.csv")
str(cars)
```

#### And here are the first few rows to get a sense of the data:

```{r}
kable(head(cars))
```

## **Average Power (HP) by Company**

This visualization will provide insights into the average horsepower provided by different car manufacturers. A bar chart can illustrate the average power for companies with a significant number of models in the dataset, highlighting the performance aspect of the different brands.

```{r}
cars$Power.HP.numeric <- as.numeric(gsub(" HP.*", "", cars$Power.HP))

cars %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Power.HP.numeric)) %>%
  group_by(Company) %>%
  summarise(AvgPower = mean(Power.HP.numeric, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(AvgPower > 0) %>% # Filter out companies with 0 or NA average power
  arrange(desc(AvgPower)) %>%
  slice(1:20) %>% # Select top 20 companies by average power for a cleaner visualization
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Company, AvgPower), y = AvgPower)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "tomato") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Average Power (HP) by Company",
       x = "Company",
       y = "Average Power (HP)") +
  coord_flip()
```

## **Distribution of Cars by Body Style**

This will help us understand the variety of car body styles in the dataset. A bar chart can be used for this purpose, showcasing the number of cars per body style.

```{r}
cleaned_cars <- cars %>%
  filter(!is.na(Body.style) & Body.style != "" & Body.style != " ") %>%
  mutate(Body.style = trimws(Body.style)) # This trims leading and trailing whitespace

# Now, creating the plot with the cleaned dataset
cleaned_cars %>%
  group_by(Body.style) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Body.style, -Count), y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Cars by Body Style",
       x = "Body Style",
       y = "Number of Cars") +
  coord_flip()
```
