Greetings all! I'm Saheb Gabadia, presently advancing towards a Master of Science in Information Management at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am interning as a Software Developer and anticipate my graduation in May 2024.

Amidst the academic rigor, I've embraced basketball and volleyball as my recreational pursuits. Every weekend, my friends and I conscientiously carve out time to engage in these sports, which serve as a delightful respite from the bustling array of work and assignments that fill our weeks.
